## 0.2.0 - 3/23/21

#### Breaking changes

* `NewVersion` now only has three fields `iOSId`, `androidId`, and `iOSAppStoreCountry`. The other fields have been turned into parameters for the individual functions.

## 0.1.0 - 3/23/21

#### Breaking changes

* `VersionStatus` can no longer be directly instantiated by the user.
* Migrated to null-safety, so certain fields are now `final` or non-null, which may break your code.

#### Non-breaking changes

* `canUpdate` now checks that the local version is *smaller* than the store version, not just that it is unequal.
